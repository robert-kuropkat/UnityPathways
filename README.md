[Play the Game!](https://play.unity.com/en/games/8a5b6a5c-2478-4798-bb8b-e93d9c8d6e30/unityessentials) on Unity Play.

<ul>
  <li>Mission 1 is just an editor exercise so there really is no game play.  If you enter an "invlid" code in the text box it shakes.  If you enter 2004 it displays fireworks.</li>
  <li>Mission 2 is a physics demonstration with a bouncing ball and blocks.</li>
  <li>Mission 3 is an audio demonstration.  You can walk through the scene using the standard mouse and WASD controls.  There is no physics on the walls or furniture so you can walk through them.</li>
  <li>Mission 4 is the programming exercise and builds a "game."    Use the standard mouse and WASD controls to vacuum up the dirt.</li>
  <li>Mission 5 is the top-down 2D version of Mission 4.</li>
  <li>Mission 6 is where we publish the game on <a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/8a5b6a5c-2478-4798-bb8b-e93d9c8d6e30/unityessentials">Unity Play</a></li>
